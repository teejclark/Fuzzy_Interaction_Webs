# Fuzzy_Interaction_Webs

This repository contains code needed to reproduce the results:

T.J. Clark-Wolf, Philip G. Hahn, Eric Brelsford, Jaleen Francois, Nicolette Hayes, Beau Larkin, Philip Ramsey, and Dean E. Pearson:
**"Preventing a series of unfortunate events: using qualitative models to improve conservation"**,
accepted for Journal of Applied Ecology.

All analyses were done in `R`. The code to conduct the simulations is in the `Code` folder. We thank Dave Ramsey for sharing the code to create the fuzzy interaction webs, in the 'fuzzy membership functions.R' and 'FCM function.R' scripts.
